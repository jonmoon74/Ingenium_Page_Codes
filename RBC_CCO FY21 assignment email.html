        <h2><strong>RECIPIENT.FIRST.NAME,</strong></h2>
      </p>
      <p>
        You have been assigned some training on Ingenium that you need to complete.
      </p>
      <p>
        Conducting all aspects of our business with the highest standards of ethics and integrity is essential to Sodexo’s mission to improve Quality of Life and contribute to the economic, social and environmental development of the communities in which we operate.
      </p>
      <p>
        In support of our commitment to ethics and business integrity, we launched <strong>Responsible Business Conduct</strong> training for all managers two years ago. This goes some way to demonstrate our rigor and governance, and showing we have a process in place for educating employees on the important role they play.
      </p>
      <p>
        This year, all Sodexo managers are required to demonstrate their understanding of Responsible Business Conduct through the completion of refresher training around key topics: anti-bribery and corruption, data protection and data security, and sexual harassment.
      </p>
      <p>
        We’ve listened to your feedback and evolved the refresher to include quick, five minute knowledge tests.  If you are able to successfully pass the knowledge tests, demonstrating that you have the knowledge required, then you don’t need to complete the full e-learning module, giving you time back in your day to focus on other important activities.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition, you are asked to complete a new 30-minute module on <strong>Corporate Criminal Offences.</strong> This learning explains why organisations need to have reasonable procedures in place to prevent the facilitation of tax evasion. You’ll see how these criminal acts work in practice, and explore the defences we have in place to protect ourselves.
      </p>
      <p>
        All Sodexo UK & Ireland managers must complete the RBC refresher and Corporate Criminal Offences training before <strong>31 March 2021.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Be Smart. Save Time. Be Responsible. Complete your training in Ingenium now.
